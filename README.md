Week 6 Challenge - Create a weather daschboard using the openweather API

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a weather dashboard where a user can search a city name and find current weather and a 5 day forecast for that location. I created this project to get the experience in handling fetch requests and using the data returned from them to dynamically fill in elements on my webpage. This project has made me better understand the various intricacies of fetch request syntax and how to move data outside of the requests. Through this project I have learned the basics of creating API keys and utilizing them to gather data relevant to my project goals. I am also feeling much more proficient in basic JavaScript syntax and furthering my use of external CSS frameworks.
